In Detail
1. Introduction to Python
1.1 What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed for readability and simplicity. It's versatile and supports various programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

2. Installation and Setup
2.1 Steps to Install Python
1.	Visit the official Python website: python.org
2.	Download the executable: Choose the version suitable for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3.	Run the installer: Follow the installation steps, ensuring you add Python to the system path.
4.	Commands: 
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
python3 --version

3. Python Basics
3.1 Variables and Data Types
In Python, variables are containers for storing data values. Python does not require explicit declaration of data types for variables.
Example:
name = "Azizul"  # String type
batch = 1.0  # Float type
Job = True  # Boolean type
3.2 Data Types
•	List: An ordered collection, which is mutable. Sign []
•	Tuple: An ordered collection, but immutable. Sign ()
•	Range: Used to generate a sequence of numbers. Like range(0,10,2)
•	Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs. No Duplication
•	Set: An unordered collection of unique elements. No element is repeated. Sign {}
Example of List:
list_data = [9, 2.9, [-3, 5], ['jenkins', 'jira']]
print(list_data)
Example of Tuple:
tuple1 = (('cicd', 'Jenkins'), ('security', 'fortify'))
print(tuple1)
Example of Range:
sequence1 = range(4, 14, 2)
for i in sequence1:
    print(i)
Example of Dictionary:
dict1 = {"name": "DevOps", "batch": 1.0, "canVote": True}
print(dict1["name"])  # Accessing value by key

4. Operators in Python
4.1 Arithmetic Operators
These are used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
Example:
num1 = 25
num2 = 5
print(num1 + num2)  # 30
4.2 Comparison Operators
These are used to compare values, such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), etc.
4.3 Logical Operators
These are used to combine conditional statements, such as and, or, and not.

5. String Operations
5.1 String Methods
Strings in Python have built-in methods that allow you to perform operations like changing case, splitting, finding substrings, etc.
Example:
str = "jenkins"
print(str.upper())  # Converts to uppercase
print(str.replace("Jen", "Doc"))  # Replace 'Jen' with 'Doc'
5.2 String as Array
A string in Python is a sequence of characters, which can be treated as an array.
________________________________________
6. List Operations
6.1 List Methods
You can perform operations like appending, inserting, removing, and extending lists.
ToolsData = ["Maven", "Ansible", "Jenkins", "Sonar"]
ToolsData.append("Fortify")  # Adding an item to the list
ToolsData.insert(1, "Docker")  # Inserting an item at a specific index
ToolsData.remove("Maven")  # Removing an item from the list
________________________________________
7. Conditional Statements
7.1 If-Else Statements
Used to make decisions based on conditions.
Example:
if "Maven" in ToolsData:
    print("Maven is present.")
else:
    print("Maven is absent.")
________________________________________
8. Loops in Python
8.1 For Loop
Used to iterate over sequences such as lists, strings, etc.
Example:
for tool in ToolsData:
    print(tool)
8.2 While Loop
Executes a set of statements as long as the condition is true.
Example:
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
________________________________________
9. Functions in Python
9.1 Built-in Functions
Python provides a variety of built-in functions like min(), max(), sum(), print(), etc.
Example:
def toolname(security, analysis):
    print("Tools:", security, analysis)

toolname("Fortify", "Sonar")
9.2 User-Defined Functions
You can create custom functions to perform specific tasks.
________________________________________
10. Recursion in Python
10.1 Recursion
A function calling itself is called recursion. It's useful in tasks like calculating factorials.
Example:
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
________________________________________
11. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
11.1 Classes and Objects
In Python, classes are blueprints for creating objects.
Example:
class Tool:
    def __init__(self, name, category):
        self.name = name
        self.category = category
    
    def display_tool(self):
        print(f"Tool Name: {self.name}, Category: {self.category}")

tool1 = Tool("Jenkins", "CI/CD")
tool1.display_tool()
11.2 Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
Example:
class DevOpsTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self, name, category, version):
        super().__init__(name, category)
        self.version = version

    def display_tool(self):
        super().display_tool()
        print(f"Version: {self.version}")

tool2 = DevOpsTool("Terraform", "IAC", "1.0.0")
tool2.display_tool()

12. File Handling in Python
12.1 Creating and Reading Files
Python allows you to read from and write to files.
Example:
# Writing to a file
file = open("text.txt", "w")
file.write("DevOps Course - Python Basics")
file.close()

# Reading from a file
file = open("text.txt", "r")
print(file.read())  # Output: DevOps Course - Python Basics
file.close()

13. Real-World Applications
13.1 Automation with Python
Use Python to automate repetitive tasks like file management, data entry, etc.
13.2 Data Visualization
Leverage libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representations of data.
13.3 Data Analytics
Use Python for data analysis, extracting insights from raw data using Pandas and NumPy.
13.4 AI and Machine Learning
Simulate human behavior and learn from past data using libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
13.5 Web Applications
Build web applications using Flask or Django.
13.6 Database Handling
Connect and interact with databases using SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL in Python.
