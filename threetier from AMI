Full Stack Deployment with AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Flask, React, MySQL & ALB on AWS 
With
Troubleshooting

1. Project Architecture
•	Frontend (React): React app deployed on an EC2 instance behind an ALB (for user traffic).
•	Backend (Flask): Flask API running on EC2 instances behind an ALB.
•	Database (MySQL): MySQL database on a standalone EC2 instance or managed service like Amazon RDS.
•	AMI: Pre-configured images for frontend and backend EC2 instances for easy scaling and deployment.

2. Detailed Roadmap
________________________________________
Phase 1: Environment Setup
Frontend Setup (React)
1.	Launch an EC2 instance with the required OS (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).
2.	Install Node.js and npm:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
3.	Clone or create your React app:
git clone <your-react-repo>
cd <react-app-folder>
4.	Build the React app:
npm install
npm run build
5.	Serve the React app using nginx or serve:
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
6.	Test the app locally by accessing the instance's public IP.
Backend Setup (Flask)
1.	Launch an EC2 instance and install Python:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
2.	Clone or create your Flask app:
git clone <your-flask-repo>
cd <flask-app-folder>
3.	Install dependencies:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
4.	Run the Flask app:
python3 app.py
5.	Test the API locally.
Database Setup (MySQL)
1.	Launch an EC2 instance or create an Amazon RDS instance.
2.	Install MySQL on an EC2 instance:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
3.	Configure MySQL:
o	Create a database and user for your application.
o	Grant necessary privileges:
CREATE DATABASE myappdb;
CREATE USER 'myappuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON myappdb.* TO 'myappuser'@'%';
4.	Update the Flask app to use the MySQL database.
Create AMIs for Frontend and Backend
1.	Stop the instances after testing.
2.	Create AMIs from the instances for frontend and backend.
________________________________________
Phase 2: Deploy Instances from AMIs
1.	Launch EC2 instances using the AMIs for both frontend and backend.
2.	Configure necessary Security Groups:
o	Frontend ALB: Allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).
o	Backend ALB: Allow communication only from the frontend or specific IPs.
o	MySQL: Allow communication only from the backend.
________________________________________
Phase 3: Configure ALBs for Frontend and Backend
Frontend ALB
1.	Create an ALB in the AWS Management Console:
o	Choose internet-facing.
o	Add listener for port 80.
o	Attach a target group for the frontend EC2 instances.
2.	Register the frontend EC2 instances to the target group.
3.	Test the ALB URL to ensure the React app is accessible.
Backend ALB
1.	Create another ALB for the backend:
o	Choose internal-facing for communication within the VPC.
o	Add listener for port 80.
o	Attach a target group for the backend EC2 instances.
2.	Register the backend EC2 instances to the target group.
3.	Update the React app's API URLs to point to the backend ALB.
________________________________________
Phase 4: Auto Scaling Groups
1.	Frontend Auto Scaling Group:
o	Create an Auto Scaling Group for the frontend.
o	Set minimum, maximum, and desired capacity.
o	Use the AMI to launch new instances.
2.	Backend Auto Scaling Group:
o	Create an Auto Scaling Group for the backend.
o	Define health checks to ensure only healthy instances are in the ALB.
________________________________________
Phase 5: Application Integration
1.	Update Flask to connect to the MySQL database using the database’s private IP.
2.	Update React to use the backend ALB's DNS name for API requests.
3.	Test end-to-end connectivity.
________________________________________
Phase 6: Monitoring and Optimization
1.	CloudWatch:
o	Set up monitoring for EC2 instances, ALBs, and Auto Scaling Groups.
o	Create alarms for CPU utilization, instance health, etc.
2.	Logging:
o	Enable access logging for ALBs.
o	Use centralized logging tools like ELK Stack for better insights.
3.	Cost Optimization:
o	Choose appropriate instance types.
o	Use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for cost savings.
________________________________________
Phase 7: Final Testing and Deployment
1.	Test the application from end to end:
o	Access the React app via the frontend ALB.
o	Verify that the React app communicates with the backend through the backend ALB.
o	Ensure the backend interacts with the MySQL database.
2.	Perform load testing using tools like Apache JMeter or Artillery.
