Core AWS DevOps KPIs
1. System Uptime
•	What it measures: The percentage of time your AWS systems (e.g., EC2, RDS, EKS) are operational.
•	Target: Typically above 99.9%.
•	How to measure: Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor system metrics and create alarms for downtime or SLA breaches.
2. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
•	What it measures: Average time to resolve system issues or failures.
•	Target: As low as possible (e.g., < 30 minutes).
•	How to measure:
o	Track incident start and end times via AWS CloudWatch or AWS Systems Manager.
o	Use ticketing systems (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow) to log resolution times.
3. Deployment Frequency
•	What it measures: The number of successful deployments to production in a specific period.
•	Target: Depends on the team (e.g., daily for microservices, weekly for larger releases).
•	How to measure:
o	Integrate AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy logs.
o	Use deployment metrics from tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.
4. Change Failure Rate
•	What it measures: Percentage of changes that result in a failure (e.g., system rollback, degraded performance).
•	Target: Less than 5%.
•	How to measure:
o	Track failed deployments using AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, or CloudWatch.
o	Log post-deployment rollbacks or incidents.

•	Target: < 10 minutes for typical environments.
•	How to measure: Measure Terraform or CloudFormation execution times.
8. Cost Optimization
•	What it measures: Efficiency of resource usage to minimize costs.
•	Target: Reduced monthly AWS spend without affecting performance.
•	How to measure:
o	Use AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to track spend.
o	Monitor unused or underutilized resources (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS).
9. Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
•	What it measures: Maximum tolerable data loss in case of a failure.
•	Target: < 5 minutes for critical systems.
•	How to measure: Use AWS Backup or custom scripts to log recovery times.
10. Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
•	What it measures: Maximum acceptable time to restore systems after a failure.
•	Target: < 30 minutes for critical systems.
•	How to measure: Test DR plans using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery or manual failovers.

Security and Compliance KPIs
11. Vulnerability Detection Rate
•	What it measures: Frequency and severity of vulnerabilities detected.
•	How to measure: Use AWS Inspector or third-party tools like Nessus.
12. Compliance Audit Success
•	What it measures: Percentage of successful compliance checks (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, GDPR).
•	How to measure: Use AWS Config and AWS Audit Manager to track compliance.
13. Secrets Management Effectiveness
•	What it measures: Use of secure methods (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) to manage sensitive data.
•	How to measure: Regular audits of secret rotation and access logs.

Operational Metrics
14. Auto Scaling Efficiency
•	What it measures: How well Auto Scaling meets demand without overprovisioning.
•	How to measure: Use AWS CloudWatch metrics for Auto Scaling groups.
15. API Latency
•	What it measures: Response time of APIs hosted on AWS services like API Gateway or Lambda.
•	Target: < 100ms for most APIs.
•	How to measure: Monitor API Gateway metrics in CloudWatch.

How to implement
1. AWS CloudWatch: System Metrics, Alarms, and Logs
Steps to Set Up:
1.	Enable Metrics Monitoring:
o	Go to the AWS Management Console.
o	Navigate to CloudWatch → Metrics.
o	Choose the relevant AWS service (e.g., EC2, RDS, EKS) and view system metrics like CPU utilization, disk I/O, and memory usage.
2.	Set Up Alarms:
o	In CloudWatch, go to Alarms → Create Alarm.
o	Select a metric (e.g., CPUUtilization for an EC2 instance).
o	Define thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80% for 5 minutes).
o	Set notification actions (e.g., send an email via SNS).
3.	Enable Logs:
o	Go to CloudWatch Logs.
o	For EC2, install the CloudWatch Agent to push logs to CloudWatch:
sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent
sudo amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:/path/to/config.json -s
o	For Lambda, ensure that the function has logging enabled via console.log or equivalent in your code.
4.	Dashboards:
o	Create custom dashboards in CloudWatch with widgets for metrics, alarms, and logs.

2. AWS Cost Explorer: Cost-Related KPIs
Steps to Set Up:
1.	Enable Cost Explorer:
o	Go to Billing in the AWS Console.
o	Enable Cost Explorer (if not already enabled).
2.	Track KPIs:
o	Open Cost Explorer → Create reports for:
	Monthly Cost Trend: View service-wise spending trends.
	Cost by Linked Account: If using multiple accounts, track spend per account.
	Unused Resource Costs: Identify underutilized instances.
3.	Set Budgets and Alerts:
o	Go to Budgets → Create Budget.
o	Set thresholds (e.g., monthly spend > $500).
o	Enable email or SNS notifications when thresholds are crossed.
4.	Visualize Cost Data:
o	Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports with Amazon Athena to query granular cost data.

3. AWS X-Ray: Latency and Tracing for Microservices
Steps to Set Up:
1.	Enable AWS X-Ray:
o	Go to the AWS Console → Navigate to X-Ray.
o	Enable X-Ray for your service (e.g., API Gateway, Lambda, or ECS):
	For Lambda: Enable X-Ray tracing in the Lambda function configuration.
	For ECS: Use the X-Ray daemon as a sidecar container.
2.	Instrument Your Code:
o	Add X-Ray SDK to your application code.
o	Example for Python:
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

app = Flask(__name__)
xray_recorder.configure(service='MyApp')
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
3.	Visualize Traces:
o	Use Service Map in X-Ray to view latency and request flow.
o	Analyze Trace Segments to identify bottlenecks.

4. Jenkins/GitLab CI/CD: Deployment Metrics
Steps to Set Up:
1.	Jenkins:
o	Install the Build Metrics Plugin:
	Go to Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Install "Build Metrics".
o	Enable Metrics Dashboard:
	Go to the dashboard → Add the Build Metrics Widget.
o	Track KPIs:
	Deployment frequency: Count of successful builds over time.
	Change failure rate: Track the percentage of failed builds.
o	Configure notifications for failed builds via Slack, email, or similar tools.
2.	GitLab CI/CD:
o	View Pipelines:
	Go to your project → CI/CD → Pipelines.
	Monitor success/failure rates and durations.
o	Enable Deployment Tracking:
	Use tags in pipelines (e.g., deploy) to identify production deployments.
o	Track Metrics:
	Integrate with Prometheus to visualize metrics.
	Use the built-in CI/CD Analytics for deployment frequency and success rates.

o	For EC2, use the following commands:
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-x.x.x.zip
unzip sonarqube-x.x.x.zip
cd sonarqube-x.x.x/bin/linux-x86-64
./sonar.sh start
2.	Connect to Your CI/CD:
o	Add SonarQube as a step in your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD).
o	Example for Jenkins:
	Install "SonarQube Scanner" plugin.
	Add the following stage to your Jenkinsfile:
stage('SonarQube Analysis') {
    steps {
        withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
            sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
        }
    }
}
3.	Track Metrics:
o	Open SonarQube Dashboard to monitor:
	Test coverage.
	Code smells.
	Technical debt.
o	Configure Quality Gates to fail builds if thresholds are breached.

Integrate Dashboards
Use centralized monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Grafana) to combine metrics from CloudWatch, X-Ray, Jenkins/GitLab, and SonarQube into a unified view.
