Real-Time Scenarios for DevOps Automation:
1: Automating Infrastructure Provisioning with AWS SDK (Boto3)
2: Automating CI/CD Pipeline Deployment with Jenkins and Python
3: Automating Kubernetes Cluster Management
4: Automating Docker Container Builds and Deployment
5: Automating Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts / Lambda

In Detail
1. Real-Time Scenario: Automating Infrastructure Provisioning with AWS SDK (Boto3)
Scenario: As a DevOps engineer, you're tasked with automating the provisioning of resources on AWS, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, or even creating VPCs. Python’s boto3 SDK allows you to interact with AWS services programmatically.
Steps:
1.	Use Python to interact with AWS using the Boto3 SDK.
2.	Automate the process of launching EC2 instances or creating an S3 bucket.
3.	Automate security configurations such as IAM roles, policies, and key pairs.
Python Script Example:
import boto3
# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
# Create an EC2 instance
instance = ec2.create_instances(
    ImageId='ami-0a91cd140a1fc148a',
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1,
    InstanceType='t2.micro',
    KeyName='your-key-pair'
)
print(f"EC2 instance {instance[0].id} has been created successfully!")
Real-Time Application: Automate the creation of EC2 instances or S3 buckets for different stages in your DevOps pipeline.

2. Real-Time Scenario: Automating CI/CD Pipeline Deployment with Jenkins and Python
Scenario: As a DevOps engineer, you’re managing Jenkins for automating continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Python can be used to automate tasks such as triggering Jenkins jobs, monitoring their status, and interacting with Jenkins API to manage pipelines.
Steps:
1.	Use the JenkinsAPI Python library to trigger Jenkins builds.
2.	Monitor the job’s status and collect logs for analysis.
3.	Automate the setup of Jenkins jobs and manage configurations.
Python Script Example:
from jenkinsapi.jenkins import Jenkins

# Connect to Jenkins server
jenkins_url = "http://localhost:8080"
jenkins = Jenkins(jenkins_url)

# Trigger a Jenkins job
job_name = 'my-pipeline-job'
job = jenkins.get_job(job_name)
job.invoke(build_params={'branch': 'master'})

print(f"Jenkins job {job_name} has been triggered successfully!")
Real-Time Application: Automatically trigger Jenkins jobs as part of your CI/CD pipeline for code builds, testing, and deployment.

3. Real-Time Scenario: Automating Kubernetes Cluster Management
Scenario: DevOps engineers often work with Kubernetes to manage containerized applications. Automating tasks such as creating namespaces, managing pods, and monitoring cluster health using Python’s Kubernetes client (kubernetes-py) can streamline these tasks.
Steps:
1.	Use Python to interact with Kubernetes clusters (e.g., create namespaces, deploy pods).
2.	Automate the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters.
3.	Automate monitoring and scaling of resources within the cluster.
Python Script Example:
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load Kubernetes config
config.load_kube_config()

# Create a new namespace
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
namespace = 'my-namespace'

namespace_obj = client.V1Namespace(
    metadata=client.V1ObjectMeta(name=namespace)
)

# Create the namespace
v1.create_namespace(namespace_obj)
print(f"Namespace {namespace} created successfully!")
Real-Time Application: Automate the creation of Kubernetes resources (pods, services, deployments) and monitor the cluster’s health with Python.

4. Real-Time Scenario: Automating Docker Container Builds and Deployment
Scenario: As a DevOps engineer, managing containerized applications using Docker is a key task. Python can automate building Docker images, pushing them to a Docker registry, and deploying them to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
Steps:
1.	Use the docker Python SDK to interact with Docker containers.
2.	Automate Docker image builds and pushes to Docker Hub or Amazon ECR.
3.	Automate the deployment of Docker containers to a Kubernetes or Docker Swarm cluster.
Python Script Example:
import docker
# Initialize Docker client
client = docker.from_env()
# Build Docker image
image = client.images.build(path=".", tag="my-app:latest")
# Push image to Docker Hub
client.images.push('my-app:latest')

print(f"Docker image built and pushed successfully!")
Real-Time Application: Automate the CI/CD pipeline for Docker containers, from image building to deployment.

5. Real-Time Scenario: Automating Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts
Scenario: A key responsibility of DevOps engineers is to monitor infrastructure health and set up alerting systems for anomalies (e.g., high CPU usage, failed deployments). Python can be used to interact with cloud monitoring services like AWS CloudWatch or third-party services like Prometheus.
Steps:
1.	Use Python to monitor EC2 instance metrics such as CPU usage, disk I/O, and network activity.
2.	Set up CloudWatch alarms based on thresholds.
3.	Automate the notification process when an alert is triggered (e.g., send a Slack message, email).
Python Script Example:
import boto3
# Initialize CloudWatch client
cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

# Set up an alarm for high CPU usage
cloudwatch.put_metric_alarm(
    AlarmName='HighCPUUsage',
    MetricName='CPUUtilization',
    Namespace='AWS/EC2',
    Statistic='Average',
    Period=300,
    Threshold=80.0,
    ComparisonOperator='GreaterThanThreshold',
    Dimensions=[
        {
            'Name': 'InstanceId',
            'Value': 'i-1234567890abcdef0'
        },
    ],
    AlarmActions=[
        'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic'
    ]
)

print("CloudWatch alarm has been set successfully!")
Real-Time Application: Monitor and manage infrastructure health, setting up alerts and automating notifications for critical issues.
